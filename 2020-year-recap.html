								<span><small><br>January 17, 2020<br></small>
								<span class="first-letra"><br>Hi everyone! For today’s post and to start fresh this year I wanted to write an introspective article about how I did during last year and what are my expectations for this new year. I feel like giving you some advice in things I have struggled with during the last months while writing something positive and inspirational that I really hope is worth of your time.<br>
								<br>I am not going to lie: 2019 had been a life changing year for me. It started with my first internship ever -which I am grateful of- and ended with me living in London and searching for a job once I graduated. So, I thought about writing a post about the things I learned last year and what I expect from 2020.<br>
								<span><br><strong>2019: What have I learned?</strong><br></span>
								
								<span></span><br>Doing a recapitulation of everything that I have experienced last year, I am mostly proud of all the risks I took, while I am aware that for the upcoming year I must work on going out of my comfort zone more often.<br><span></span>								
						        <br><strong>Working is hard.</strong><br>I often listened people from my inner circle talk about how tired they were from work, but I did not notice until I had to do the work my own. Do not get me wrong, it is an experience and something we all have to do at the end of the day, but I expected it to not be that time consuming. Also, I have learned that if you do what you want -or try different things- your job is not as hard as if you were working in something you do not enjoy at all. I am glad of the choice I made and probably that is the reason I am where I am now. <br>
                    
							    <br><strong>Listen to your body when it needs help.</strong><br>I must say that I started taking more serious doing exercise at the same time I was interning so I had a me time every day or every two days. It really helped me get through stress, sickness and tiredness -as ironic as it may sound-. Trust me, it is important to listen to your body, to move it and give it some energy, but also it is important to rest when needed, to do nothing when your health and mood tells you so. Though, I have not been fueling my body the correct way nor treating it the way it should be treated. Maybe I needed to hear this some time ago but loving yourself is the only way you are going to get through what you are dealing with. <br>
						
								<br><strong>Overcome your fears.</strong><br>Since I turned 18 I did not want to have my driving license because I was scared of driving and everything car related really did not catch my attention. But back in September I promised myself that I would give it a try, and so I did. I am still dealing with my driving classes but I must say I am halfway through it. Maybe I will have my license in 2020? Who knows, but I enjoy driving and I never thought I would. <br>
								
								<br><strong>Being an graduate does not give you a job.</strong><br>I probably may tattoo this phrase in my forehead. All the way through my degree I had very clear that I wanted to study a master’s degree after graduating, but the price of the ones I would love to study are not affordable for me yet. That is why I decided to start searching for a job right after I got my diploma. The problem? Experience is a requirement and how am I suppose to have it if I am not being given an opportunity? But there is light outside of the tunnel if you work hard and start focusing on what you want to do by taking courses, listening podcasts or just being curious about the area you want to work in.<br>

								<br><strong>2020: What do I expect?</strong><br>
								<br><strong>Work hard to achieve my dream job. </strong><br>Becoming the person I want to be will be the ultimate resolution for this year and blogging more is a way to reach to it. I have realised that writing about my interests and getting to inspire people is what I most enjoy right now and I want to work hard into it. <br>
								
								<br><strong>More self-care.</strong><br>Last year was an introduction for me in this aspect, I was still learning how to exercise and eat properly but for this year I am turning wellness, self-care and self-improvement into a lifestlye. I am eager to do more and learn more about fitness and nutrition to become the best version of myself. Trust me, taking care of both your inside and outside it what we should thrive this new decade - <strong>self-care is a must!</strong><br>
								
								<br><strong>Become more eco-conscious.</strong><br>Climate change is real and we must do something to help fight it. I want to become more conscious about fashion and stop spending money in companies that do not have ethical work policies and pollute our planet, while I want to start buying local and become a vegetarian at some time. <br>

								<br><strong>Try new things and challenge myself to do things I would not do.</strong><br>New city, new life, they said. I will start this year by living in London so I will take every opportunity this city will give me to try new things, meet new people and do things I would not normally do. Why not trying dance classes? I have always loved to dance. Why not to draw again and become a master at it? Why not take ukelele lessons and start using the one my parents got me when I went through my indie-wannabe phase? There are plenty of things that we do not do because of fear and I am not bringing negativity with me this time.<br>

								<br><strong>Cut all of your toxic relationships.</strong><br>I have noticed that people will envy you when you achieve what you want and become the person you are meant to be, because they are not able to do the same yet. I will put myself first, I will put first those who really care, embrace and support what I do and who I want to become.<br>

								<br><strong>Reading more.</strong><br>This would be my latest resolution but I think is an important one. I have been wasting time in social media doing nothing for the longest time when there are plenty of books to read. At some time I used to read a lot and I really enjoyed it, but the constant consumption of short content, as Instagram Stories or Netflix’s TV shows, have turned me into a slow reader. I want to start reading again but most importantly taking time to do it and really appreciate and value what I am reading.<br>

								<br>If you have reached this point, thank you. What do you think of this kind of post? What are your resolutions or expectations? Let me know through my social media. As always, I do really hope you enjoyed reading me. See you soon,<br>
								<br>Yanira<br>
